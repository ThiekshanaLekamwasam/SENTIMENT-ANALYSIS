John C.,"i have owned the momentum 2’s for many years and love them. but, after the battery started to fail and took over 8hrs to charge i decided to upgrade. here are my thoughts:sound - really good, but different to the 2’s. took some time to get used to but i really like the sound now.battery - amazing. 60 hours is huge and makes such a difference not having to charge so regularly.comfort - the 2’s were great but these are on another level. can wear for hours on end without getting hot or ever feeling uncomfortable.look - the 2’s looked amazing with the ivory colour. these look ok, but do not stand out. build quality is excellent. no creaking on mine.controls - i hate the touch controls and miss having a button to adjust the volume. if adjusting, then it is easy to activate a control. changing the volume is hit and miss. i have turned touch controls off as they are too unreliable. it would be good to switch just some of the controls off and just have volume, or have the ability to change via the app. maybe having less controls would help it work better.connectivity - multiple devices works fine. i’ve had no issues but it niggles me that when you connect, you get a lovely voice that tells you it has connected, but when you connect a  bluetooth device, a lady from essex tells you it is connected. it is so wierd they use different voices for different announcements.all in all a great pair of headphones but i wish sennheiser would address some minor niggles.",awesome headphones…. but…,4.0,08 10 2023
R Griffiths,"at first i felt these headphones were a mixed bag of tricks. i had read other reviewers had problems but having an earlier sennheiser model and being familiar with their app i hoped for the best. however it took ages to get going. the on off control is tricky - to get a bluetooth connection the on button must be pressed till the lights flash rapidly. it's also hard to tell if it's really switched off. i then had a nightmare trying to connect to the sennheiser app. my older set connects to both the app and bluetooth in seconds and works brilliantly but the momentum 4 took me the best part of an hour plus another thirty minutes to install a firmware update. the problem i had, i think, was i initially tried connecting using a fire10 tablet and the app just didn't like it. as a last attempt i tried the fire max 11 which worked at once. i then then downloaded the update by which time i had had enough electronics for one very stressful evening. the next morning i tried again with the fire 10 and all was well. it seems the update resolved issues connecting to the app but unless you have another device or can find another way to update it's frustrating. sennheiser do say their app is designed for phones primarily and do offer support with tablet related problems but in the event i didn't need to contact them. since that first attempt i have had absolutely no problems with connection at all on any of the three devices i use.the sennheiser sound is superb on the momentum 4. i very much like the sound check system which helps to establish your personal presets by offering several sets of three settings - you select your preferred out of each set. i like a wide range of music including jazz, opera, rock, metal and in a few minutes was able to save settings for each genre. i had done this before with my older sennheiser with great success but the sound on this newer set is brilliant. unlike other reviewers i like the app. once you find your way round it it's easy to use and the online manual is comprehensive and clearly written.there is only one button on the momentum 4 much to my relief - and as i have said that one needs a bit of learning to operate effectively. other controls are by touch and these work extremely well  - swipe up and down for volume, touch for stop start etc.  unless you are committed to buttons this is a great improvement. the set is extremely comfortable with a neat flat appearance. i have noticed no clicking or creaking noises and no heat to my ears. it stays connected even when i move around a lot and stops as soon as removed from the head. the case is well designed with room for cables and guidance notes.i have used the set for about 40 hours so far, battery is still 50% charged. noise cancellation is easy to adjust on the app or the headphone touch control and seems good although i am in a quiet room. i haven't tried a phone connection as i am in an area where mobile reception is appalling.overall i am very happy but more comprehensive guidance notes in the initial paperwork would have saved me a frustrating hour - but i say that about anything new!!if your primary wish is great sound at a medium price this is a wonderful buy. but be ready to take time to establish connections and don't miss the update.",wonderful sound now that initial connection issues resolved,5.0,13 07 2023
Simon Pawlin,"i wasn’t sure how good these were going to be as iv not had a pair of wireless premium over ear cans before. i have been using apple airpods pro and found these to be very average with rubbish bass. i wanted some headphones that were comfortable, had an open sound but with good bass. not blast your ass off bass mind you, but bass that would be quality.set up was a little bit of a mixed bag and i had to faff about a bit at first, as it didn’t work first time. but it  was a smooth experience the second time around.sound quality is excellent once you tailor it to your taste. the sound is open and expansive and bass feels well controlled, deep and heavy in tracks where that is intended and gentle where it is not. so i really enjoy that it pounds to dance tracks and rumbles to pop and rnb. mids and highs are tight and clear. have not experienced any distortion at any volume.i would say that noise cancelling is ok. it’s not the best but not bad either. if this is critical for you, look elsewhere. there isn’t any pressure sensation you sometimes get- well not that i noticed anyway.the good? these are really light and comfortable and the sound is very very good with quality bass, mids and highs. a real highlight though is the battery; i have had these for a while now and only charged them fully once- which is brilliant. another thing i like is these have a great case.the bad? well, i have had a really mixed experience with connecting to the pc with the usb-c cable. it sometimes works but mostly doesn't. also, it can often repeatedly announce it is ‘connecting’ or ‘disconnecting’ which can get a little annoying. it’s seems to do this when you have multiple devices nearby. but that seems to have settled over the last few weeks and doesn’t happen as often as it used to.overall, for the price, i am really happy with these. they are quality. i have listened to the ridiculously priced apple airpods max and i think these sound better and are more comfortable. i can’t compare to sony mx5 as only listened to them once. i think you’ll be happy with these great headphones",comfortable and quality sound,4.0,04 08 2023
Dezmo63,"read a very long review by a lady who had trialed hers for months, like what she had to say, didn't like the fact that other well known brands were not even in the top five for recommended, so i've used mine and i am impressed with the battery life after playing music at decent volume with bass boosted checking app and seeing that battery hasn't even left 100% mark, further playing and only after a few hours it's still got 80% left. i do like one feature in particular if you take headphone off your head the music pauses and when you put them back to your ears the music continues, brilliant as you don't miss the tracks you were listening to unlike other headphones which would play the music off the head. very comfortable to wear virtually no drag on your head from the cradle very firm seating of ear cups no leakage from outside. be careful not to increase the volume too much when using the equaliser as i noticed that the volume is capable of making these headphones dance off your head (vibration intense). bought mine off amazon as i wanted them asap, but you will save a good bit by shopping around. best headphones i've ever had and they will last for years.",60 hour battery life. amazing.,5.0,01 10 2023
Gabriele Fazio,"this is the 3rd wireless headphones i owned in the same price range. the other 2 being from the other 2 main brands selling this type of product. compared to the other 2 brands, these are more balanced. noticeably less kick on the low frequencies. i find them nicer for jazz but less engaging for r&b and similar. it's matter of taste, great quality overall. battery life much better than the others.on the other side, controls are much worse than both the other brands. being a very smart product it has almost no buttons, but whenever you accidentally brush against any of their surfaces, even by turning your neck, they pause, start, or do something else. it can be rather annoying. the features of recognition of movement to automatically turn on/off is useless: you can't listen to music while you sit on a train or they'll turn off after a few minutes because you've not moved your head enough to keep them turned on. overall a bit of a faff to use sometimes.","good quality, bad controls",4.0,06 09 2023
Tim Myers,"first off - the first pair of these i got suffered from the random noise/hissing and crackling in one ear fault that these headphones are known for (check out the online forums). so they got returned (which took amazon a long time to process). the second pair work fine: the sound quality is excellent and the battery life and connectivity are really good. they are not however what i would call ‘premium’. the fabric headband is fine but the rest of the headphones feel plasticky and cheap which is a surprise at this price point, especially in comparison to the momentum 3 wireless which i own which cost about the same.",great sound but not as ‘premium’ feeling as you might expect at this price point,4.0,06 09 2023
RAB,"i was surprised at the quality of the sound from the momentum 4. there is a bass boost available but i certainly haven't found a need for it. how it is achieved i don't know but the sound is less centralised than other headphones i use. this has the effect of separating instruments in the music listened to.i find adjusting the volume a bit hit and miss. it is a pity volume control isn't in the sennheiser app. sometimes it takes several attempts at swiping my finger up and down before the volume will respond. there is an audio message when you reach the minimum or maximum volume which can be useful.you can adjust the transparency of the ambient sound by pinching two fingers on the touch sensitive right pad. what i use a lot is a double tap on the right pad which switches from anc to ambient and back. the anc can be set to be fully sound cancelling, fully ambient, or in-between via the sennheiser app.a single tap pauses a recording if it is possible to control the source via bluetooth. i only listen to my hifi so don't use the gestures for pausing or switching tracks so the single tap just mutes the sound which i find useful.the manual says that the headphones are atpx adaptive (atpx,  aptx low latency) or aac. if the transmitter doesn't support these it uses sbc. i have tried three different transmitters and couldn't get low latency which results in lipsynch problems watching tv. if the transmitter has atpx adaptive it connects using that. if not it connects using aptx. i could get the connection to switch to atpx hd but not atpx ll. this is frustrating as i specifically was looking for headphones that would connect via atpx ll. i contacted sennheiser support and was informed that despite what is in the manual the headphones do not work with atpx ll. aptx adaptive doesn't have the low latency of atpx ll and so the lipsynch issue watching tv can't be avoided unless you connect using cable instead of bluetooth. something i have experienced as well is if you have the tv sound on while listening with the headphones you can hear both with a long delay. presumably because the sound from the tv external to the ear pads and inside the ear pads is very similar so the noise cancelling isn't so effective. very disappointing.the sennheiser app enhances the momentum 4 with a lot of configuration options. although some people are disappointed at only having a three band equaliser to play with, there are a number of preset settings to suit what you are listening to. if you want to create your own you are presented with choosing the best sound to your liking as you listen to the sound you are configuring for. it does this several times making adjustments each time and then finally the settings are saved with a name of your choice. an unusual option i haven't met before is the ability to save settings for zones.useful things about the momentum 4 is the ability to press the button on the right ear pad and the current battery capacity is announced.  the headphones can be connected via bluetooth, wired via an aux audio jack, and wired via usb. the headphones can also be used purely for sound cancelling only if you want to shut out a noisy environment when doing something like reading.lastly, when i first received the headphones i wore them for almost 12 hours watching tv and listening to music. they are the first headphones that i have owned that didn't cause any discomfort aftera period of use.",very good sound quality and effective anc. not so good for watching tv.,4.0,21 02 2023
Nack,"i have had the momentum 2 headphones for years and i recently tried the momentum 3's. i didn't like the skinny cups on the 3's and the headband was uncomfortable on the top of my head after thirty minutes. but, they did look great, with an excellent build quality.right off the bat, i can say the 4's build quality is nothing to write home about. they creak and click as you move your head or your jaw and they're quite hot on the ears. the cups are fairly shallow and since they only twist in two directions, i found it difficult to get them comfortable on both ears. one ear always felt like it wasn't at the right angle and both ears were always touching against the odd plastic ridge that exists just inside the cups. the headband was comfortable and all-in-all, the headphones were fine to wear for long periods without hurting you. i just could never find that sweet spot.they look, par for the course for the wireless headphones available today, which is rather disappointing, but not a big deal. the sound quality does make up for it. i'll get to that though.keeping with the build quality, the headphones have foregone the buttons that came with the previous incarnations, and they now have touch controls. i'm not a fan of touch controls, but like i said, the sound quality was pretty great, so i really gave it my best shot. however, i found that they were too sensitive to the touch. a few times, i switched songs or paused with my shoulder. more times i tried to turn the volume up or down and ended up doing nothing at all, but still recieving the beep announcement of being touched. what finally put the nail in the coffin for me was the fact that the volume doesn't work in intervals, it's an actual gauge on the right headset. so i found myself constantly going a little too high or a little too low. like, i'm walking in the park, i just want to up the volume one ""jump"", not three.something else, you can adjust the active noise cancelling on the right cup, too. but, honestly it just felt like it was giving an already over active touch control another thing to do badly when all you want is to turn the music down.a lot of people have claimed the headphones had problems connecting to their phone. i didn't have any such issues. however, to access the app, it would take forever to connect and then you'd have to wait ages to actually be able to move onto the next screen.the app itself isn't fantastic. the equaliser only has three adjusters, there's no way to turn off the anc altogether. it's always on, just like the momentum 2. a step back from the momentum 3, which had a very welcome off switch. hopefully they change that in the future. you can turn off the auto pause feature though, and also a couple of other features. i did that because i like pulling my headphones onto one ear to keep listening while i'm checking what others are saying.from what i tested, auto pause works well. auto on and off worked well for the most part, but i did have them turn themselves on once, so i always used the power button on the side to be certain.the sound stage is pretty fab. it sounds deep and far reaching, with crisp audio. i messed around with the sad equaliser for a while to test variations, but honestly, that sound pretty great from the get-go. so i didn't bother with the equaliser for real listening. i love all kinds of music genres and i tried just about all of them on these babies and was not disappointed. they do have a word habit of sounding better after a particular volume level, but the previous momentum's did that too.the battery life is massive. i changed them once in twenty days i had them, to no issue. very impressive.sadly though, i couldn't get past the creaky, clicking plastic, the uncomfortable cups and the teeeeerrrrriible touch controls. i think if the volume had been at intervals, i would have kept them. clicks and all.so, for the price, they're a fantastic pair of headphones. amazing sound quality, great battery life, reliable bluetooth. sort of comfortable.great, if you can get over the other small things.why'd you take away the buttons, sennheiser? :(",great sounding headphones let down by a few things,4.0,20 09 2022
Jordan,"got these headphones as i heard good things about them and heard they had better bass and an overall better soundstage than the sony xm5's and can confirm after testing both and also comparing to the xm4 (which sounds muddy in comparison)these headphones work well on bluetooth when connecting to my iphone, sound is good and with the app you can customise how you want it to sound and as i love bass i did make it a heavy bass eq which these headphones proved they are up to the task and they are the best sounding headphones i've ever used.wired mode is not so good unfortunately, if you turn it up a bit too much or have a bass eq on an external dac or your device then it can become distorted (doesn't take much) so if you like loud music while wiring up then i'd probably not recommend but using bluetooth you can have it louder and not have any issues. when on the wire also i noticed it will change what type of anc it'll use fairly often (sometimes when just moving my head?!).","sound good, bluetooth good, wired not so.",4.0,09 08 2023
David Carew,"i also own sony wh1000 xm5. these are much louder and the sound is just as precise. i tend to use the momentums more as i love the bass. not too great when using them to listen to the tv.  love the fact that i hardly need to charge them at all. the noise cancelling isn't on par with the sony aad sometimes when. listening at high volume there is a bit of a sharp squelch although it could be spotify.  i have to admit though, the first time i put these on i was blown away by the sound!!edit: the noise cancelling doesn't seem to work too well whilst on a call, the person/scouldn't hear due to traffic and after moving the slider to it's minimum point it doesn't seem to make a difference.  it works when my music is playing  though but as i mentioned above, the xm 5 trounced these  on the anc and transparency.  it could be something i've overlooked,  and will ensure that i'm right, and will update my review accordingly.  i cannot emphasise enough though,  how much i love the signature sound of these cans, and am about to invest in some momentum 3  tws buds.",amazing sound,4.0,03 07 2023

Mark.,"quality packaging. decent build. slippery smooth. easy to set up....... but!i don't know what i was expecting from £300 headphones when i have alresdy had xm4s, mt50x, and a pair of soundcore q30s ( which were an absolute bargain and for me sounded better that the sonys) but the sound is disappointing. i can hear all the details, the instruments, but the voice is muffled, not to bad but as though they are singing through a towel. maybe this will change with some use. but first impressions..... dissatisfied, disappointed. but definitely more bass weight that the xm4s £300. absolutely not as clear as the soundcore q30s (£60). **update. returned. don't understand what all the fuss is about especially for £300.",returned.,4.0,20 05 2023

SteffAna,"i’m so conflicted by these headphones. the sound is amazing and they have a great sound stage for closed back headphones. this is sadly let down by the software, in particular the anc which causes a hissing and buzzing sound in my left ear that sometimes gets so loud it’s almost painful. this can, of course, be avoided through not using the app - which isn’t needed as they are near perfect and balanced for me out of the box.i’ve listened to a few different styles out the box but my main music style is metal. one of my go to songs for headphone testing is nothing else matters, and listening to this song on these headphones takes me back to when i first saw metallica live (well, as closed to this as wireless closed back headphones can i suppose).i also bought the px7 s2’s and while i really wanted to like those, they don’t really make me feel anything when listening with them. i’m not sure if it has to do with the mids or sound stage as, while they’re great headphones, they seem to have something missing that i can’t quite put my finger on.i let my boyfriend, who mainly listens to hip hop, try both of these out. when i played nothing else matters on these he literally closed his eyes and it was like he was transported somewhere else lol.the conflict comes in to where i’d expect headphones of this price to function as expected, vs does the sound and feeling these produce matter if i don’t necessarily need to use the app anyway. i believe sennheiser are working on an update and fix but i honestly am not holding my breath.i’m going to explore some wired headphones and would probably recommend the same to anyone who doesn’t need the convenience of bluetooth. all in all, if you are considering buying these against one of the other popular cans at this price point you’d have to decide what is most important to you - if it’s sound quality then 100% get these if you can live without the app. if it’s software support and anc then you’ll sadly be disappointed with these.",so conflicted,3.0,17 02 2023
Kyle,"i had the samsung buds live which i really enjoyed and i still do use them. but i was told by ent that i should stop using them and use over ears as they believed in ears wasn't helping my issues. i asked around, did a bit of research and settled on these instead of the other good option of sony. this is probably going to sound odd but these things are addictive, they sound so good that sometimes i just like laying in the dark and listening to some music. being honest with you i can't tell you anything from a technical standpoint, i'm not an audio technophile though i do like quality audio.here is what i can tell you.the noise cancelling is very good, i can't hear the car even when sitting at the back. it drowns out conversations. i've yet to find something it doesn't get rid of but i have only had this a month and two weeks. i may edited this at a later date.the battery life i love. the buds live had forty hours which i was very happy with but having an extra twenty to play with is just lovely. right now i'm having to charge them around once a week but i suspect if you were to use these for half your working day then you'd probably be looking at twice/three times a week which being honest i think is great.these feel great on the head, i don't get any pressure on the head and i don't feel like these pull. they're in my opinion quite light so sit nicely. one thing i don't like a tiny bit is that the extending an retracting the headphones is a little bit stiff if you're not getting the angle quite right which makes adjusting them on your head sometimes a little bit annoying. this isn't an issue if you remove them to do it.the app that you can download as many complaints about the software, i've only used it the once so can't really say anything. what i can say is that i'm happy with the default settings. voices are crisp and music sounds great. when i can be bothered i might play around with the settings and create some modes. there is a youtube video showing this off in a comparison video between this and the sony and demonstrates the differences in settings allowing you to create better vocals if that's primarily the feature of your songs or more bass if you're into heavier bass featured music.",personally i'm impressed.,5.0,06 02 2023
Paul,"had this for three weeks now. it is a great sound across the range and the noise cancellation is stupendous. but then having worked fine, it stopped connecting to the audio. i seem to have fixed it now but it took hours of trial and error. on the way i have had two firmware upgrades, which tells me they launched it prematurely. each one takes at least 30 minutes and each has failed once before succeeding. i had to do a factory reset and start again when nothing else seemed to work. the problem is that there is just one button on the headphones and you have to try to work out what it's doing from the app. except it doesn't always tell you. and the instructions are less than optimal. the headphones give various tones and beeps and voice messages but they are often opaque. just hope they settle down now but i shouldn't have to go through this. ps i note other users have had similar problems to me and some report turning off a couple of the fancy features solves the connection issues. these are the auto on-head detection and auto-on-off.","great sound, flawed control and app",4.0,24 09 2022

AK,"overall, these are decent headphone. for the price i wish i had gone with jbl. my biggest complaint is the bluetooth pairing. i consistently have trouble pairing when switching between my phone and laptop, sometimes the headphones won't connect to anything at all, and one time whenthey wouldn't connect i couldn't even reset them. so i couldn't use them for about a week until they just decided to begin pairing again. these also won't age well. the ear-cushion isn't replaceable (some over-ear headphones have removable and replaceable cushions), and i've already started to notice the material is degrading. so, once the cushions go , i assume i'll have to replace the entire product. the touch-controls are also a bit of a pain. because they're on the right ear, pretty much anytime you adjust or remove/put on the headphones it initiates a command. so the volume, noise cancelation, etc. is constantly being changed.they're comfortable, and it's nice to be able to control sound output via the app, but i wouldn't buy these again given the price, how non-user-friendly they are, and how mid the sound quality is.","not worth the price. difficult to use, ok sound quality",3.0,17 01 2023

Will Lakeman,"i have been a loyal user of sennheiser headphones since the 90s, and this is the third pair of momentum ones i have owned in addition to dj headphones, studio headphones and earbuds. i am beyond disappointed by the user experience of these and will think twice about ever buying a sennheiser bluetooth product. i am required to reconnect them to bluetooth up to several times a day (by turning them off and on again) and there appears to be no reliable trigger for them switching themselves on or off automatically.sometimes they turn on (in their case) when they are in my work bag, or because my car moves. sometimes however i move one cup off my ear to speak to somebody and they turn off completely, or won't stop playing music and i have to fumble for my phone.the touch panel is also unreliable. sometimes it is activated by my collar or scarf, sometimes it totally ignores my finger. unfortunately if you do disable the automatic on/off feature the bluetooth problems become worse, particularly when attempting to use the controller app, which itself is annoying and sometimes doesn't work. the momentum 2 had a little rocker, that did every important job without issue, including turning the headphones on and off. in the name of convenience we have a product so annoying it has made me consider using another brand.i will however say that, when working, the sound quality is excellent, as is the battery life. the noise cancellation also seems pretty good.",constantly disconnects from bluetooth and touch panel control is infuriating,2.0,12 03 2023
undedjed,i have had these for about a week now and so far i think that they are outstanding. i was upgrading from the sony wh1000-xm3. i also tested out the sony wh1000hxm5 and the bowers and wilkins px7 s2 and i returned both of these and kept the momentum 4s. i found them the most comfortable (the bowers and wilkins clamped too tight). the battery life is ridiculous. the touch controls work well as does the on head detection (this was really bad on the px7 s2 and sometimes they would randomly pause when i turned my head). the anc is probably not as good as the px7 s2 and definitely weaker than the sony's but it's good enough for me not to notice other sounds when listening to music. but the main trump card is the sound. it's leagues ahead of the sony's with a wide open soundstage (and i have been streaming tidal masters using ldac and aptx hd). songs i've listened to for years sound amazing with great instrument separation. the px7 s2 also sound amazing albeit with a narrower more focussed sound and less pronounced highs and it was hard to decide between these and the m4s. however the px7 s2 cost £50 more and as an overall package the momentum 4s won out. lets see if i develop any issues going forward but no regrets so far.,amazing headphones,5.0,21 12 2022

LEE,"after reviewing multiple choices of headphones from sony,bose,bang & olufsen i decided to give the moment 4 a shot.build wise they look very 2021/22 (plain with no frills) i'm guessing to keep with the current trend like sony and bose.sound and comfort wise these were excellent and the sound stage was great but for £300 you would expect them to beunfortunately that's where the good points end.the main problem i had was the software. they worked well for about 2 days then i tried to turn them off and got no audio beep to say they were off???? then eventually after several attempts to turn them off the eventually did.went to bed and then the next morning went to turn them on for my daily walk and again no audio beep to say they were on and no voice to say connected 🤷checked the bluetooth on my phone and they were connected but when i pressed play i got no sound at all.but if i pressed the power button on the headphones to summon google it worked but i couldt hear herso i then tried to turn them off and again they wouldn't turn off.so i went into the app to do a factory reset which actually worked and stored the headphones out..... great 😃that was until the next day when i went to use them again.and the same frustrating thing happened again 😡after looking online for help that's where i discovered i wasnt alone. i found hundreds of threads on reddit complaining of exactly the same thing.sadly that's when i decided to return these in exchange for the sony xm5for a £300 headset these problems should be ironed out in the initial testing and i know that a software update in the future will most likely fix these problems but i don't want to sit with a pair of headphones that don't work until this time.but a special mention to amazon because they are by far the best company on the planet for no hassle returns and exchanges..i'm actually sitting here writing this review with my replacement xm5 headphones on less than 24 hours after asking for an exchange.and i still have to send back the momentum 4's lol5 star service as always amazon 🔥",great sounding headphones sadly let down by poor software,2.0,11 09 2022
Amazon Customer,"i bought the momentum 4 after having owned a momentum 3.generally, these are good headphones with quite good sound quality, noise cancellation and and an app to control all the features.following are the challenges that i've found:1. noise cancellation can only be controlled through the app and there is no button or dial (in similiar to the b&o h95 which has a cool dial for controlling the noise cancellation.2. also very annoyingly sen had removed all buttons and there is merely one button to control everything:  power up, pairing, power down - it would have been much better having a dedicated button for on/off and one for pairing at least as you have to otherwise go through long press cycles to get to what you need. so for instance if i want to pair and it's already on, i will have to press long - get it switched off, press long again - get it powered on and continue pressing just for it to get to pairing mode.3. support for multiple paired devices is not great - i've found that if i have more than 2 devices with bluetooth on and i'm trying to connect to a previously paired 3rd device, it's not going to work and i literally have to either switch off bluetooth on the other pair devices, just in order for it to connect to the 3rd device or go through the full pairing process to connect to it.4. equalising is not great - it's based on only 3 main frequencies and when increasing then other frequencies are decreased.5. reset - the only way to supposedly reset is press the single button for over 30 secs but then it's not always working5. reliability - for me that's a big disappointment - my momentum 4 headphones died completely just 2 months after i've purchased it. i was shocked. initially even when it was paired and connected to devices i couldn't hear anything not even it's on voice commands, then i tried to turn it off, but it would never get turned on again. tried to reset but again even when pressing reset for over 30 secs, the only things was a red light flashing once, but reset wasn't working. had the headphones have an on/off button it might not have happened, but that's what happens when you're depending on one button to do everything and then it won't power app again.6. and following all of that my 2nd pair (i bought 3 of these unfortunately for multiple family members) has the same fault. it won't power on again. try to reset pressing the only multi function button and you'll get a blink of a red light after 30 seconds but that's it. won't turn on anymore.i think senheizer reliability with those headphones had dropped to literally zero. paying 300 pounds for a supposed high quality headphones just for them to completely die after a few months is really frustrating.and if it died on you after a few good months you can't even return it and you can only get it sent for repair and you'll have to wait for weeks over weeks with no headphones.stay away from these!",disappointing reliability and control functionality is not best,1.0,20 12 2022
Robert Sutcliffe,"the sound and noise cancellation are great and the design is not special but also not ugly. the main issue i have with these headphones is the inconsistent software user experience. sometimes it connects, and sometimes it doesn't. sometimes it auto pauses, sometimes it doesn't. sometimes it auto powers off and sometimes not. often i've put them on in the morning the battery is dead because they must have decided to stay on all night. often when i put them on it will play spotify when i'm currently watching a youtube video. i'm having to switch off all the smart features because they are kind of dumb. you don't really get a sense of what the power button does. does it switch on or off the headphones? sometimes it does. it just feels like i own an unruly child and not a set of headphones. there have been multiple firmware updates, none of which seem to make these rock solid from a user experience point of view. hoping they sort this out.",great headphones let down by inconsistent software functionality,3.0,03 10 2022

Mr Usman Khan,"do not waste your time with this overrated sennheiser momentum 4 pair of anc headphones. the sound: small closed in muffled audio, limited bass, treble is dead, causes air pressure on the ears with bass and drum beats similar to airplane cabin pressure. this is all while using the aptx codec. trust me, buy the philips fidelio l3 anc over ear headphones for clear, open, detailed sound with good bass response. just don't bother using the dodgy unstable philips app. the sony wh-1000xm4 is rubbish too, don't waste your time on that unless u like muffled up sound with thick fat over the top bass....",rubbish sound quality,1.0,15 03 2023
R. Wallace,"the original momentum 4’s were quite simply unbeatable in terms of price & features vs value for money, indeed imo they only lagged those of bose and sony in their anc capability but surpassed both the latter in terms of sound quality (unmatched at this price point) and that staggering 60hr battery life.  i could write pages on that sound quality, suffice to say that it is remarkably detailed (you’d swear gilmour was in the room on listening to the opening of wish you were here), expansive, neutral and crisp. the bass is tight, never muddled and the sound staging is immense. it is as close to hearing the original as you can get. i also find them comfortable to wear, the app is fantastic (and easy to navigate) and whilst the anc isn’t quite as good as the competition, it still performs admirably. for those that don’t know, all the latter is the reason why these were tech radar’s best buy in 2022 and they received loads of 5-star, glowing reviews.as for the limited-edition model here, well, the originals were rather plain looking and these look significantly “snazzier” with the contrasting padded headband and expensive looking copper inlays, meaning, whilst their earlier cousins were discrete, these are more, look at me i own a pair! the only decision anyone looking for a best in class set of wearable, wireless headphones needs to make after reading this, is whether to opt for these and show them off, or save a few pounds and go for the originals, either way, you won’t be disappointed! 5 glorious stars.",incredible battery life and audio reproduction - best in class!,5.0,27 09 2023

Willow,"in one word - phenomenal....!!!!they come in a very basic box, which i love - no excessive or unnecessary packaging to clog up landfill. less is definitely more.the headphones, wow. just....wow. i could literally write a book about how epic they are.the case is great - really sturdy offering lots of protection. they have airplane leads and adapters, a usb-a to usb - c cable and a trs cable.the are really lightweight and so comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time. the ear cushions feel plush and the build quality is first class.  sleek and minimalist design - they just look like incredibly stylish premium headphones.the noise cancellation is excellent and they block out most ambient sounds, leaving just enough to hear train/airport announcements which is great as i travel a lot. they have an anc setting which will automatically adapt to your surrounding environment and you can also adjust this on the touch controls by using a pinching motion.the sound quality and engineering is exceptional. the clarity and depth are incredible even on the 'out of the box' settings but you can easily adjust and customise within the app to suit your personal preferences and audiophiles will be able to finetune their performance.the touch control on the right earcup is quite sensitive and takes some getting used to, but once mastered it makes using the commands a breeze (you'll need to activate some commands within the app for them to work).within the app there is so much you can control in there, it's really very easy to navigate and it's packed with features which i'm still working my way around.there is just so much to like about them - the on head detection, smart pause, the touch controls, 60 hours of battery life.they really are remarkable.if you value high quality audio, comfort  - they're worth every single penny of the investment. i can't recommend them enough.","wow.....just, wow....!!!!",5.0,07 09 2023

L,"very good sound obviously from sennheiser however i would expect it for £350. the soundstage doesn't feel super wide, i can hear a lot of details that i wouldn't normally hear though. for me personally, i would like a bit more punchy bass but it isn't bad by all means.when you first start wearing it, the clamping force is quite firm on your head which gave me a bit of a headache at first. after a few hours of wearing (over several sessions) you do get used to it and/or it loosens up a bit so isn't so bad. the ear cups are a bit on the small side for me and the tips of my ears just touch the edge of the ear cups, perhaps that's more me though because the earcups are quite large. you do get a little warm wearing these, especially at the moment when we are around high 20's for the uk.the anc seems to be very good, i can't compare to the rest of the major players but compared to my previous experience, it blows it out of the water. i tested it with an air conditioning unit since i'm not hopping on a plane anytime soon and it was basically silent. noting that this ac unit was loud. i only wish that you could turn off the anc to conserve battery when passive noise isolation is sufficient.the controls are touch which you either love it or hate it. this one to be fair isn't too bad but volume controls are slightly tedious and difficult to refine so you may end up blowing your ear drums. i recommend just doing it on the device if you can. you can also customise the control from the app which is quite bad in honesty. you can do all your basic things and sign in for a more personalised profile but for me it is slow and crashes sometimes so i played around with it and haven't gone back.i do love the feature where the headphones disconnect after being idle for a while bit will reconnect when you pick them back up. it feels like a very seamless experience especially when you take them out from the case.included accessories is good but i haven't tested them so can't comment further apart from you get a charging cable, aux cable, airplane adapter and a very nice (but bulky) case.the final thing i'd like to note is that qc may not be the greatest as one of my ear cups has not been attached properly and is slightly ajar (see photo). for £350, this is unacceptable.overall, this is a great pair of headphones but i would probably give this 3.5 stars if i could just based on the price. i guess at this price, the aesthetics become part of the cost as you can definitely pick up comparable sounding headphones for less.",toastie ears,4.0,06 09 2023

Anthony Meyer,"i was so excited to try these out, but then have realyb let me downthe bluetooth on the device continues to attempt to connect to other devices after i have connected to my phone and am listening to music.this is notable as, if i listen to music alone at home, i do not have an issue, but if i walk in public spaces, the audio stops and starts.i read a bunch of reviews on reddit mentioning the same thing, so clearly a bug that was not picked up in testing.unfortunately when you spending this amount on headphones, you wouldn't expect your bluetooth connection to break.would no recommend buying this product.",really dissatisfied,1.0,06 10 2022

Simon Perry,"i liked these headphones at first. they are comfortable and fit well on the head without being too obtrusive (unlike other headphones). however the connection is dreadful. they won't connect to the sennheiser app. i managed to connect to my phone after a lot of trouble. but they won't connect to any other device, such as my laptop. and i can't connect to 2 devices and switch between them. i haven't had this problem with other headphones from sony and b&o, so there must be something wrong with these. also, the noise cancellation is not brilliant and lets in a lot of background noise. the more i used them, i'm afraid the more disappointed i became.",rubbish connection,1.0,03 09 2022
C. D. GRIFFITHS,"i’ve had to return two pairs of these due to connectivity issues with an iphone 13. the other problem is that when you answer a call, they usually cut it off straight away.  shame because the sound is good.",cons outweigh the pros unfortunately,2.0,27 09 2022

Mr. P. Charles,"loved my gsp650s thought the momentum 4 would be a premium headset. they are, but the moment you utilize the mic the sound stage drops sound turns to garbage. this seems like a limitation with bluetooth but the same happens with the supplied wire. as such returning these and getting a proper gaming headset with sadly, worse sound but functionally better.",do not buy for gaming,1.0,26 11 2022

Suzi Edwards-Alexander,"bought two pairs. returned one pair because they wouldn't reliably turn on or pair. but the design of the controls is just terrible. the touch panel keeps getting bumped and doing things, it randomly turns the mic on and off during calls. there is only a single physical button that you have to hold in for different lengths of time to do anything.they sound good, but are unusable so that's irrelevant. avoid.",unusable and unreliable,1.0,15 09 2022
