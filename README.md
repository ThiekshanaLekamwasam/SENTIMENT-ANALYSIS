Hi, this is my Sentiment Analysis Project for the IT CODING course.
It performs a web scraping on Amazon to retrieve reviews of a product.
The scraper is limited to the first 10 pages then Amazon will block it.
IF YOU FIND A WAY TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.
Then we proceed in depth with the Sentiment analysis going from NLP using Vader and RoBerta.
Finally, we select, fine-tune, and decide which machine-learning model is better for this analysis
Please let me know if you find any issues or problems with my code, thanks a lot.
Some of the graph doesn't show up.

TISSI
